    "Summary": "Physician: That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?\n\nPatient: Yes, I always do.\n\nPhysician: What did you feel immediately after the accident?\n\nPatient: At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away. Physician: That's encouraging. Let's go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain. Physician: I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?\n\nPatient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. Physician: Did you seek medical attention at that time?\n\nPatient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\n\nPatient: It's not constant, but I do get occasional backaches."
