Q-How would you train an NLP model to map medical transcripts into SOAP format
A-Current implementation uses a hybrid pipeline with scispacy for biomedical entity extraction, pytextrank for graph-based summarization of patient dialogue, and rule-based mapping to SOAP JSON structure, avoiding custom training.​
  With unlimited resources, fine-tune BioMistral-7B or Flan-T5-XXL on ACI-Bench dataset (thousands of patient-doctor conversations) for end-to-end SOAP generation, capturing inferences like fall risk from symptoms.

Q-What rule-based or deep-learning techniques would improve the accuracy of SOAP note generation?
A- Negation (negspacy): A crucial accuracy upgrade. It uses dependency parsing rules to ensure that if a patient says "No chest pain", we do not extract 'chest pain' as a symptom. This fixes the most common NLP error (false positives).
   Section-Specific Summarization: Instead of summarizing the whole text, we only run pytextrank on the Patient's turns to generate the HPI (History of Present Illness). This ensures we don't accidentally include the Doctor's questions in the patient's history.
